“I simulated 3,000 concurrent users hitting my API with Artillery.
The API handled about 1,600 successful requests, with an average response time of ~360ms.
As expected for free-tier resources, some requests timed out or returned errors at high load, demonstrating the need for further tuning at higher scale.”
